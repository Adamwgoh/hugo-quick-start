MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations, is a derivative of DevOps (Developer Operations), that seeks to set up concrete steps in the lifecycle of a machine learning development. As a machine learning engineer, there lies a variety of responsibility that you'll need to solve in order to get to your final goal: A model that solves a specific scenario by simply querying an output out of it.

During my time at Netvirta, I volunteered and sold the idea of creating an MLOps architecture for the company. It involves several constraints and uses AWS Sagemaker to get it running, as well as the need for human in the loop for automatic relabelling. On top of that, those data had to be of highest security standard (SOC-II).
